# MIXED MESSAGES

## About
**Mixed messages** is a *Codecademy* portfolio project which returns a message to console when it runs.
This program is made of vanilla Javascript so when downloaded it's fine to run with node right after setting up.


## Functionality
This **mixed messages** in particular runs through arrays of words to get each of them to form a title for a metal song.
To add more variety to the titles just add a *verb* into the <firstWordArray> array, *adverb* into <secondWordArray>, *preposition* into <thirdWordArray>,
*adjective* into <fourthWordArray> and *noun* into [fifthWordArray].

## More
The original idea (no idea if this is from even before) was inspired from the YouTube video of SteveT (Steve Terreberry) "How To Be POWER METAL".
